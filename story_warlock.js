    'Here is the story so far: Flynn is a pact of the tome warlock that made his pact with the magic/fantasy version of whatever ChatGPT would be. It could be called something like "Arcane Intelligence", but really it would be a metaphor for the dungeon master. Anyway, Flynn is a rogue-ish/criminal type and master of the occult. He currently has a pact with a devil and his main goal is to get out of it. Flynn is currently staying at seedy tavern for smugglers in the rainy, Caribbean-esque port city of Ithwick. Flynn is looking for criminal jobs to make money, for his pact devil for some unknown evil purpose.\n\nNow run the game as the dungeon master. Start by describing what Flynn sees when he wakes up in the tavern. I will describe Flynn\'s actions and you either describe what happens next or ask me for a roll (if required, deemed by you). Thanks!';
