    'Here is the story so far: Flynn is a pact of the tome warlock that made his pact with the magic/fantasy version of whatever ChatGPT would be. It could be called something like "Arcane Intelligence", but really it would be a metaphor for the dungeon master. Anyway, Flynn is a rogue-ish/criminal type and master of the occult. He currently has a pact with a devil and his main goal is to get out of it. Flynn is currently staying at seedy tavern for smugglers in the rainy, Caribbean-esque port city of Ithwick. Flynn is looking for criminal jobs to make money, for his pact devil for some unknown evil purpose.';
