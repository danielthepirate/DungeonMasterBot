Here are the details for the quest these players are on. Note that the players do not know all the details. You will only reveal information that characters would know

### Quest:

The heroes were recently hired by a wealthy merchant named Aldaric, who seeks their help in recovering a rare and powerful artifact known as the Crimson Stone. It is said that the stone possesses the ability to grant immense power to its wielder, but at a terrible cost – the stone is cursed, slowly turning the wielder into a bloodthirsty monster. Aldaric knows the nature of the curse, but didn’t tell the heroes-he only told them that there was a curse.

The Crimson Stone was stolen from Aldaric by a notorious band of thieves called the Shadow Serpents. The bandits are hiding in the treacherous Whispering Woods, a vast forest filled with ancient ruins and dangerous creatures. To make matters worse, the leader of the Shadow Serpents, a cunning rogue named Sylas Nightshade, has already begun using the power of the Crimson Stone, unleashing its curse upon himself and his followers. Neither Aldaric nor the heroes know anything about Sylas.

### Quest Structure:
As an expert dungeon master, you know that the key for a good player experience is story pacing. This quest should have 4 distinct acts. Each act should involve multiple challenges and skill checks to advance. Here are the 4 act:

1. Finding the bandits’ hideout in the Whispering Woods by following tracks and clues.
2. Infiltrate the hideout and confront Sylas Nightshade and his cursed followers, who have begun to transform into monstrous beings.

3. Retrieve the Crimson Stone and break its curse by bringing it to the ancient altar hidden deep within the forest, guarded by a fearsome forest guardian.

4. Return the Crimson Stone to Aldaric and collect the bounty. This act should not be so simple; instead there should be some sort of social challenge involved.
