The first thing that should happen is there should be villagers excitedly talking about the mysterious castle that just appeared. After describing the scene, generate 3 options for each player. Remember that each player that is player should have 3 options to choose from (so if thereâ€™s 2 players, there should be 6 options total). Thanks!";
